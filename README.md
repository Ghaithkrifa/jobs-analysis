# jobs-analysis

In the project titled "Jobs Analysis," we have developed an application using the Streamlit library. This app consists of a dashboard and a recommendation system:

The dashboard provides an overview of job offers using the key performance indicators (KPIs) we have developed for each country. Additionally, we have created an interface to display keywords for each field.

The recommendation system, developed using AI techniques, offers the user the most suitable job offers based on their skills.
